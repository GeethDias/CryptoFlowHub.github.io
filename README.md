# cryptoflowhub: Cipher Text Encoding and Decoding Web Application
Welcome to CryptoFlowHub, a web application designed for encoding and decoding cipher texts using various cryptographic techniques. This project was developed as part of the Systems and Network Programming Module at SLIIT, under the guidance of Dr. Lakmal Rupasinghe.

# Features:
Caesar's Cipher: Explore the fundamental Caesar's cipher technique, attributed to Julius Caesar. Encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting characters by a fixed number of positions along the alphabet.
Stream Cipher: Dive into the world of stream ciphers, an encryption method that processes data one bit at a time. Encrypt and decrypt binary messages using a key stream for real-time secure communication.
This project provides a hands-on experience with modern software deployment practices in cloud environments, leveraging containerization through Docker. Enhance your understanding of cryptography and encryption techniques while experimenting with the user-friendly interface.

Developed by: GeethDias

Explore the world of cryptography through practical examples and enhance your understanding of encryption techniques. Discover the fascinating world of Caesar's cipher and stream ciphers, all wrapped up in a user-friendly web interface. Feel free to contribute and expand upon this educational tool for a deeper dive into cryptography!
